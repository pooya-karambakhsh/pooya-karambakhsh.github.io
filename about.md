# About Pooya Karambakhsh


<img src="/assets/img/pooya_img.jpg" alt="Pooya Karambakhsh" class="main-photo">

I’m Pooya Karambakhsh — an economist, data strategist and researcher who builds practical tools, writes on political economy and partners with for-purpose organisations to drive impact. My work bridges rigorous economic analysis, modular system design and field-ready implementation.

## My Journey

I began as a civil and geotechnical engineer, modelling soil behaviour and validating numerical simulations in C++ and Python. Over time I gravitated towards data roles in the not-for-profit sector, designing CRMs in Salesforce, automating ETL pipelines with SQL and Power Automate, and crafting Power BI dashboards to inform senior leadership.

Alongside practice, I’ve pursued multidisciplinary research:

- PhD, MA (Research) and Graduate Certificate in Political Economy, The University of Sydney  
- MSc and BSc in Civil & Geotechnical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology  

I’ve published on topics ranging from global profit rates and Australia’s retail workers to accumulation theory, plus technical studies on cone penetration and pressuremeter tests. Outside academia, I translate literary and political texts between English and Persian.
