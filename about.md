# About Pooya Karambakhsh


<img src="/assets/img/headshot_friendly.png" alt="Pooya Karambakhsh" class="main-photo">

I’m Pooya Karambakhsh — an economist, data strategist and researcher who builds practical tools, writes on political economy and partners with for‑purpose organisations to drive impact. My work bridges rigorous economic analysis, modular system design and field‑ready implementation. You can explore my full CV or connect with me on LinkedIn to see recent projects and collaborations.

## My Journey

I began as a civil and geotechnical engineer, modelling soil behaviour and validating numerical simulations in C++ and Python. Over time I gravitated towards data roles in the not‑for‑profit sector, designing CRMs in Salesforce, automating ETL pipelines with SQL and Power Automate, and crafting Power BI dashboards to inform senior leadership.
Alongside my in‑house roles, I also take on select consulting projects through Dianoetic, applying the same rigour and practical focus to external collaborations.
My academic path has been multidisciplinary:
- PhD, MA (Research) and Graduate Certificate in Political Economy — The University of Sydney
- MSc and BSc in Civil & Geotechnical Engineering — Sharif University of Technology
I’ve published on topics ranging from global profit rates and Australia’s retail workers to accumulation theory, plus technical studies on cone penetration and pressuremeter tests. Outside academia, I translate literary and political texts between English and Persian.

## What I Work On

**Building Practical Data Tools**  
I design and implement offline‑first CRMs, automation pipelines and open‑source utilities — such as Bibliopy — that help mission‑driven teams work effectively in resource‑constrained environments.

**Advancing Economic and Policy Research**  
My research spans political economy, labour issues, profit dynamics and accumulation theory. I publish in peer‑reviewed journals, present at conferences, and develop analytical frameworks that bridge theory with real‑world application.

**Collaborating Through Dianoetic**  
Through Dianoetic, I take on select consulting and integration projects in parallel with my embedded roles in organisations — partnering with nonprofits, advocacy groups and select collaborators to deliver data strategy, systems integration and numerical modelling solutions.
