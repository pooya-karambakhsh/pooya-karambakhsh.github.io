# About Pooya Karambakhsh

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/headshot_friendly.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Pooya Karambakhsh" class="main-photo">

Iâ€™m Pooya Karambakhsh â€” an economist, data strategist, and researcher with nearly two decades of interdisciplinary experience spanning political economy, geotechnical engineering, and applied data systems. I design and implement **humanâ€‘centred, technically rigorous data solutions** that help nonprofits, advocacy groups, and public institutions turn complex information into actionable insight.

My work bridges **rigorous economic analysis**, **modular system design**, and **fieldâ€‘ready implementation**. I combine handsâ€‘on technical expertise with a collaborative, capacityâ€‘building approach, enabling missionâ€‘driven teams to work effectively in resourceâ€‘constrained environments.

## My Journey

I began as a civil and geotechnical engineer, working across design offices, construction sites, and laboratories â€” from managing inâ€‘situ testing teams and producing technical and financial reports, to modelling soil behaviour and validating numerical simulations in C++ and Python.  

Over time I gravitated towards data roles in the notâ€‘forâ€‘profit sector, designing CRMs in Salesforce, automating workflows with Microsoft Power Automate, and crafting Power BI dashboards to inform senior leadership.  

Alongside my inâ€‘house roles, I also take on select consulting projects through **Dianoetic**, applying the same rigour and practical focus to external collaborations.

My academic path has been multidisciplinary:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ **PhD**, **MA (Research)** and **Graduate Certificate** in Political Economy â€” *The University of Sydney*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ **MSc** and **BSc** in Civil & Geotechnical Engineering â€” *Sharif University of Technology*  

Iâ€™ve published on topics ranging from global profit rates to the powers of Australian retail workers, as well as technical studies on cone penetration and pressuremeter tests.

## What I Work On

**Building Practical Data Tools**  
I design and implement offlineâ€‘first CRMs, automation pipelines, and openâ€‘source utilities â€” such as *Bibliopy*, an offlineâ€‘capable bibliographic management tool for academics and researchers â€” that help missionâ€‘driven teams work effectively in resourceâ€‘constrained environments.

**Advancing Economic and Policy Research**  
My research spans political economy, labour issues, and profit dynamics. I publish in peerâ€‘reviewed journals, present at conferences, and develop analytical frameworks that bridge theory with realâ€‘world application. I also write for *Think Hammerly*, where I explore politicalâ€‘economic questions in a semiâ€‘academic but accessible style â€” combining dataâ€‘driven analysis with clear, engaging narrative.

**Collaborating Through Dianoetic**  
Through Dianoetic, I take on select consulting and integration projects in parallel with my embedded roles in organisations â€” partnering with nonprofits, advocacy groups and select collaborators to deliver data strategy, systems integration, and tailored modelling solutions.
