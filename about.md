# About Pooya Karambakhsh

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/headshot_friendly.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Pooya Karambakhsh" class="main-photo">

I’m Pooya Karambakhsh — an economist, data strategist and researcher who develops practical, human‑centred tools, writes on political economy, and partners with for‑purpose organisations to drive impact. My work bridges rigorous economic analysis, modular system design and field‑ready implementation.

## My Journey

I began as a civil and geotechnical engineer, working across design offices, construction sites, and laboratories — from managing in‑situ testing teams and producing technical and financial reports, to modelling soil behaviour and validating numerical simulations in C++ and Python.  

Over time I gravitated towards data roles in the not‑for‑profit sector, designing CRMs in Salesforce, automating workflows with Microsoft Power Automate, and crafting Power BI dashboards to inform senior leadership.  

Alongside my in‑house roles, I also take on select consulting projects through **Dianoetic**, applying the same rigour and practical focus to external collaborations.

My academic path has been multidisciplinary:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **PhD**, **MA (Research)** and **Graduate Certificate** in Political Economy — *The University of Sydney*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **MSc** and **BSc** in Civil & Geotechnical Engineering — *Sharif University of Technology*  

I’ve published on topics ranging from global profit rates to the powers of Australian retail workers, as well as technical studies on cone penetration and pressuremeter tests.

## What I Work On

**Building Practical Data Tools**  
I design and implement offline‑first CRMs, automation pipelines, and open‑source utilities — such as *Bibliopy*, an offline‑capable bibliographic management tool for academics and researchers — that help mission‑driven teams work effectively in resource‑constrained environments.

**Advancing Economic and Policy Research**  
My research spans political economy, labour issues, and profit dynamics. I publish in peer‑reviewed journals, present at conferences, and develop analytical frameworks that bridge theory with real‑world application. I also write for *Think Hammerly*, where I explore political‑economic questions in a semi‑academic but accessible style — combining data‑driven analysis with clear, engaging narrative.

**Collaborating Through Dianoetic**  
Through Dianoetic, I take on select consulting and integration projects in parallel with my embedded roles in organisations — partnering with nonprofits, advocacy groups and select collaborators to deliver data strategy, systems integration, and tailored modelling solutions.
