# Collaborate

I am available for select collaborations in research, policy analysis, and nonprofit data strategy through [Dianoetic](https://www.dianoetic.com.au).

---

With over 12 years in research and 7+ years in mission‑driven data roles, I bring the perspective of someone who has worked inside nonprofits — understanding their constraints, culture, and operational realities first‑hand.  
I blend engineering precision, economic rigour, and human‑centred design to help organisations transform fragmented data into sustainable impact.
