# Projects

A selection of work spanning academic research, technical development, and applied data solutions for mission‑driven organisations.

---

## ** The World Rate of Profit (PhD in Political Economy)  **
An in‑depth investigation into long‑term trends in the global rate of profit, combining historical data analysis with classical political economy theory. The research examines structural shifts in accumulation and their implications for economic stability and inequality.

---

## ** Particle Flow in Granular Soils (PhD project in Geotechnical Engineering) **
Developed a custom C++ simulation engine to model particle interactions in granular soils. The work advanced understanding of soil behaviour under varying stress conditions, with applications in civil engineering design and geotechnical testing.

---

## **Transnational Australia — The Power of Australian Retail Workers**
A research project exploring the structural power of retail workers in Australia as part of the global working class. Combined quantitative labour market analysis with qualitative insights to assess bargaining power and transnational dynamics.

---

## **Cone Penetration Test — Database Approach**
Designed and implemented a database‑driven method for analysing cone penetration test (CPT) data. The approach streamlined data storage, retrieval, and interpretation, improving efficiency and consistency in geotechnical site investigations.

---

## **Pressuremeter Test — Numerical Simulation**
Applied numerical modelling techniques to simulate pressuremeter test results, enabling more accurate interpretation of in‑situ soil properties and reducing reliance on costly field trials.

---

## **Custom CRM and Database Architecture**
Built a tailored CRM and database system using Salesforce to unify disparate datasets, automate workflows, and improve reporting accuracy. Delivered significant cost savings and reduced manual data handling.

---

## **Data Architecture and Integration for a For‑Purpose Organisation**
Designed and implemented a complete data architecture overhaul, integrating multiple systems and automating data flows. The solution improved operational efficiency, reduced duplication, and enabled real‑time reporting for decision‑makers.
