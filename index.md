      <p>
        I’m an economist, researcher, and data specialist working at the intersection of economic insight, technical systems, and social impact.
        For about a decade, I’ve helped nonprofits and for‑purpose organisations, advocacy institutions, and public organisations with research, systems, and strategic insight, most recently as a macroeconomics and research mentor at the National Reserve Bank of Tonga.
