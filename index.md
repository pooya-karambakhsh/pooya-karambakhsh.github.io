      <p>
        I’m an economist, data strategist, and researcher working at the intersection of economic insight, technical systems, and social impact.
        Over more than a decade, I’ve helped nonprofits and for‑purpose organisations turn complex data into actionable insight — designing solutions that are rigorous, human‑centred, and built to last.
