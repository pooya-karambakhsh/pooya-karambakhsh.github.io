# **Portfolio**

Over two decades, my work has spanned economic research, data systems architecture, and engineering — from analysing global profit trends to building offline‑capable CRMs and modelling the behaviour of granular soils.  
This portfolio presents selected projects that illustrate the breadth of my expertise and the impact of my work.  
For a complete professional history, you can <a href="/assets/docs/Pooya-Karambakhsh-CV.pdf">download my CV</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pooya-karambakhsh">visit my LinkedIn profile</a>.

## **Current Focus**

### **Macroeconomic and Research Mentoring**
Working with the National Reserve Bank of Tonga to strengthen capacity in research, data analysis, and writing. The focus is on building methodological rigour, improving clarity in outputs, and embedding reproducible practices that support the Bank’s institutional development.

### **BiblioPy**
An open‑source Python tool for bibliometric analysis, including academic productivity and collaboration, without reliance on proprietary platforms. Designed for researchers, writers, and organisations who need a lightweight, offline‑capable way to organise references. Built with simplicity, transparency, and long‑term maintainability in mind.

### **Offline CRM**
A modular, offline‑first customer relationship management system tailored for nonprofits and advocacy groups working in low‑connectivity environments. Combines robust data capture with seamless syncing when online, ensuring teams can operate effectively anywhere without sacrificing data integrity.

## **Economic Research & Analysis**

### **Analysing the World Rate of Profit**  
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/WRP.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Particle Flow in Soil by Pooya Karambakhsh" class="float-right">
*PhD Thesis, The University of Sydney (2024)*  
Developed a new approach to measuring and interpreting the world rate of profit, contributing to debates in political economy on global capital accumulation. The research combined historical data analysis with theoretical innovation, offering a framework for understanding long‑term profitability trends.

### **The Powers of Australian Retail Workers**  
*Published in Global Labour Journal, Vol. 11, Issue 2 (2020)*  
Investigated the structural and associational power of retail workers in Australia as part of the global working class. The study examined labour issues, union density, and transnational corporate structures, situating retail labour within global production and distribution systems.

I also share ongoing commentary and analysis through [Think Hammerly](https://thinkhammerly.wordpress.com), a space for essays, reviews, and data‑driven explorations of profit dynamics, labour issues, and policy impacts.

## **Technical & Engineering Projects**

### **Numerical Simulation of Particle Flow in Granular Soil**  
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/particle_flow.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Particle Flow in Soil by Pooya Karambakhsh" class="float-right">
*ARC Centre for Geotechnical Science and Engineering, University of Newcastle (2012–2016)*  
Designed and implemented numerical models of geotechnical problems using Discrete Element, Finite Element, and Finite Difference Methods. Enhanced Yade and Abaqus with C++ and Python scripts to simulate particle flow and penetrometer tests, validated through laboratory experiments.  
Produced visualisations and technical reports for academic and industry audiences.

### **Horizontal Stress of Sandy Soils Using CPT**  
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/CPT.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Cone Penetraiton Test in Sandy Soils by Pooya Karambakhsh" class="float-right">
Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran (MSc Research)
Investigated the determination of in‑situ horizontal stress in sandy soils through calibration chamber experiments with Cone Penetration Tests (CPT). Developed and validated empirical relationships between cone tip resistance and the coefficient of earth pressure at rest (K₀), offering a more reliable method for estimating lateral stresses in cohesionless soils without the need for undisturbed sampling.

### **Geotechnical Consulting Engineer – Nargesi Earthfill Dam**  
*Tamavan Consulting Engineers, Tehran, Iran (2011–2012)*  
Managed an in‑situ laboratory team to oversee geotechnical design and construction for dam, road, and tunnel works. Delivered technical and financial reports, and developed 3D visualisations to support project planning and stakeholder communication.

## **Data Systems & Consulting**

### **Database Development**  
*Database Specialist (Jan 2025 – Aug 2025)*  
Designed and built a complete Salesforce CRM tailored to senior management needs, integrating multiple flows and forms. Developed NationBuilder–Salesforce automation using Zapier and Python, reducing development costs by over 75% and cutting annual subscription costs by $3k.

### **Systems Management**  
*Data and Systems Manager (Jan 2024 – Aug 2025)*  
Led CRM (Salesforce) enhancements, including Marketing Cloud Account Engagement (Pardot), delivering a 20% project cost saving and reducing subscription costs by up to 40%.  
Automated manual processes, saving over 500 annual hours, and implemented integrations with Mailchimp, Funraisin, Calendly, Zapier, and Humanitix.  
Provided training, documentation, and strategic reporting to improve program assessment and fundraising outcomes.
