# Economic Analysis
I am an economist and researcher with a PhD and MA (Research) in Political Economy from the University of Sydney.
My work examines long‑term economic trends, labour market structures, and the institutional forces that shape inequality and development.
This page is a brief introduction to my academic and analytical work — for the full collection of essays, reviews, and in‑depth analyses, visit my blog Think Hammerly.

## Publications & Research Outputs
My economic research has been published in peer‑reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and academic theses. Selected works include:
- The World Rate of Profit — Doctoral thesis analysing global profit trends and their structural determinants.
- Australia’s Retail Workers — Master’s thesis and journal article (Global Labour Journal, 2020) examining labour power in the retail sector.
- Social Structure of Accumulation — Journal article exploring macroeconomic phases and institutional change.
- Conference Papers — Presentations on accumulation theory and related political‑economic frameworks.


## About Think Hammerly
Think Hammerly is my dedicated space for exploring political‑economic questions in a semi‑academic but accessible style.
It brings together:
