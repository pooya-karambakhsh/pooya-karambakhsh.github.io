# Economic Analysis

Welcome to the Economic Analysis section—your gateway to data-driven essays and semi-academic explorations of political-economic issues. Here, I apply classical and political economy frameworks to real-world puzzles, all with one aim: to surface the structures driving inequality and suggest paths to empower disadvantaged communities.

## About This Work

My writing draws on a multidisciplinary foundation:

- PhD, MA (Research) & Graduate Certificate in Political Economy, The University of Sydney  
- MSc & BSc in Civil and Geotechnical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology  
- Peer-reviewed publications on Australia’s retail workers, global profit rates and macro-economic phases  
- Conference papers on accumulation theory and technical studies in geotechnical methods  

Each post combines theoretical rigour with clear, approachable language—because understanding complex systems shouldn’t require insider status.
