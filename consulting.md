# Consulting

Delivering evidence‑driven data strategy, robust systems design, and actionable insights for for‑purpose organisations.

---

With over 12 years in research and 7+ years in mission‑driven data roles, I bring the perspective of someone who has worked inside nonprofits — understanding their constraints, culture, and operational realities first‑hand.  
I blend engineering precision, economic rigour, and human‑centred design to help organisations transform fragmented data into sustainable impact.
